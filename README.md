# Advent of Code 2022

Solutions for my Advent of Code, 2022 challenges.

Solutions are in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.com) and uses
[Deno](https://deno.land). Challenge of each day is separated in
separate folders.

For running a challenge just do:

```bash
$ deno task run DAY_NUM PART_NUM
# This runs day 4's part 2 script
$ deno task run 4 2
```

Make sure to populate the `inputs` directory before running a script.
